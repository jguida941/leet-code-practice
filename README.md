# Leet Code Practice

This repository is my personal playground for chipping away at LeetCode concepts.  
Each topic (binary search, graphs, trees, etc.) lives in its own directory, and
inside each topic there is a small language-specific workspace (right now only
Python) that contains:

- a `*.py` file for the working solution or draft
- a matching `*.md` note file for ideas, edge cases, or follow-up thoughts

## How to use the repo

1. (Optional) Activate the local virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate`
   or create your own Python venv.
2. Pick a problem directory (for example `two_pointers/python`) and run the
   script with `python whatever-problem.py`.
3. Update the problem's markdown file with any takeaways, optimizations, or
   remaining questions.

> Progress is summarized in `index.md`. Most entries are still TODO while I build
> out solutions, but the structure is ready to fill in as practice continues.

## Future improvements

- Fill in real solutions for every topic.
- Add test cases for each pattern to make regression checking easier.
- Expand beyond Python once the core problem set is complete.
