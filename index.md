# Practice Index

This checklist keeps track of every topic folder in the repository, even when a
solution has not been written yet. Update the **Status** column as progress is
made or link directly to the finished solution/notes.

| Topic                      | Directory                           | Languages | Status | Notes                                                   |

| Hash Map Lookup            | `hashmap_lookup/python`             | Python    | TODO   | Need frequency/counting examples.                       |
| Sliding Window             | `sliding_window/python`             | Python    | TODO   | Draft common patterns section.                          |
| Sorting and Scanning       | `sorting_and_scanning/python`       | Python    | TODO   | Plan to add comparator demos.                           |
| Stack & Queue              | `stack_queue/python`                | Python    | TODO   | Outline stack vs queue use-cases.                       |

| Two Sum                    | `two-sum/python`                    | Python    | Done   | `two-sum-solved.py` with three practice variants.       |
| Two Pointers               | `two_pointers/python`               | Python    | TODO   | Template plus sample cases.                             |

Legend: **TODO** – structure exists but no working code yet. Use `In Progress`
while iterating and `Done` when a working solution is in place; link directly to
files when helpful.
