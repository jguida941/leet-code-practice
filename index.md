# Practice Index

This checklist keeps track of every topic folder in the repository, even when a
solution has not been written yet. Update the **Status** column as progress is
made or link directly to the finished solution/notes.

| Topic                       | Directory                 | Languages | Status   | Notes                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| Binary Search               | `binary_search/python`    | Python    | TODO     | Scaffolded files, needs solutions. |
| Dynamic Programming Basics  | `dynamic_programming_basics/python` | Python | TODO | Yet to outline transitions.        |
| Graphs Basic                | `graphs_basic/python`     | Python    | TODO     | Set up traversal templates.        |
| Hash Map Lookup             | `hashmap_lookup/python`   | Python    | TODO     | Need frequency/counting examples.  |
| Sliding Window              | `sliding_window/python`   | Python    | TODO     | Draft common patterns section.     |
| Sorting and Scanning        | `sorting_and_scanning/python` | Python | TODO | Plan to add comparator demos.      |
| Stack & Queue               | `stack_queue/python`      | Python    | TODO     | Outline stack vs queue use-cases.  |
| Trees Basic                 | `trees_basic/python`      | Python    | TODO     | Insert traversal cheat sheet.      |
| Two Sum                     | `two-sum/python`          | Python    | TODO     | Classic hashmap intro problem.     |
| Two Pointers                | `two_pointers/python`     | Python    | TODO     | Template plus sample cases.        |

Legend: **TODO** – structure exists but no working code yet. When a solution is
ready, switch the status to `In Progress`, `Done`, or link to the exact file.
